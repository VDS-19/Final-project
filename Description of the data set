This simulation is using so-called coarse-grained MARTINI force field, in which each bead (the smallest resolution element) 
represents a chemical group (3-4 atoms or more), not a single atom. Groups of these beads form residues which make molecules. 
Typically, smaller molecules have only one residue; large molecules, like proteins or DNA, can have multiple residues.

The dataset contains 21 residue types. One of them is POPC, the lipid molecule that forms the membrane bilayer. 
The rest are amino acids forming the protein.

There are 17 bead types, abbreviated as BB, C{1..2}A, C{1..3}B, C4{A..B}, D3A, GL{1..2}, NC3, PO4, and SC{1..4} 
(using the brace expansion notation).

Water molecules were present in the simulation but were removed from the output to save storage space.

The file sim.part0001_protein_lipid_popc.gro describes the initial setup with 9453 beads and 1756 residues 
in the standard GRO format, stored as human-readable ASCII. The main body of the file lists all beads, one line per bead. 
Here we describe formatting of all fields using the first bead as an example:

'    1' is the residue number (5 characters): 1 to 1756
'PRO  ' is the residue name (5 characters): 21 unique names
          ALA=alanine ARG=arginine ASN=asparagine ASP=aspartate
          CYS=cysteine GLN=glutamine GLU=glutamate GLY=glycine
          HIS=histidine ILE=isoleucine LEU=leucine LYS=lysine
          MET=methionine PHE=phenylalanine POPC=ourLipid PRO=proline
          SER=serine THR=threonine TRP=tryptophan TYR=tyrosine
          VAL=valine
'   BB' is the bead name (5 characters): 17 unique elements
          BB=backbone C{1..2}A C{1..3}B C4{A..B} D3A GL{1..2}
          NC3=choline PO4=phosphate SC{1..4}
'    1' is the bead number (5 characters): 1 to 9453
'   6.692' is x-position in nm (8 characters)
'   8.569' is y-position in nm (8 characters)
'   8.462' is z-position in nm (8 characters)
'  0.0038' is x-velocity in nm/ps = km/s (8 characters)
' -0.0789' is y-velocity in nm/ps = km/s (8 characters)
' -0.1406' is z-velocity in nm/ps = km/s (8 characters)


The files 5us_traj_popc_protein_lipid_popc.xtc and 15us_traj_protein_lipid_popc.xtc 
store the trajectory in the standard XTC format during the first 5 microseconds (2502 frames) and 
the last 15 microseconds (8502 frames) of the simulation, respectively.
