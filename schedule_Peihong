Plans for these two weeks:
 * Think of 1~2 candidate UIs for the visualization system
 * Combine the candidate UIs with teammates and prepare to meet with client
 * Meet with client to decide the best solution to our vis system and finalize our design
 * Create dummy application layout 
 * Check if all data is ready to move on to the next phase
