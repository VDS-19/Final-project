Abstract:
Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations have been used to study the movement or trajectories of the atoms in various systems. It uses Newton’s equations of motion and a potential function (also called force field) to simulate the dynamics of a system till it reaches equilibrium.. It can be used to study biophysical system such as molecular dynamic simulation of phase separation in lipid bilayer, namely the separation of liquid-ordered phase and liquid- disordered phase at some critical temperature in a lipid bilayer membrane. However due to large mounts of particles/molecules which require highly computations) and complex dataset to be produced, an efficient visualization tool is needed to select proper parameters and numerical method to minimize the computation and the numerical integration of cumulative errors.
